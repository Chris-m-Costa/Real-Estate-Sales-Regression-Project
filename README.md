# Mid-Bootcamp-Real-Estate-Regression_Project
 
 This project is based on a dataset of ~22000 home sold in King County, WA. between 2014-2015 ranging in age from 1900-2015 and sales price ranging from $78,000-$7.7 Million. The variety of features in this data set will be used to construct a supervised machine learning model to attempt to predict the sales price of a given home. 
 The project will also aim to determine those factors that are the most responsible
